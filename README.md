## ðŸ“– About

After watching *The Imitation Game*, I was deeply inspired by the incredible story of Alan Turing and the pivotal role of the Enigma machine during World War II.  
Driven by that excitement, I created this project to simulate the Enigma machine â€” not just as a standalone program, but as a modern **Java Enterprise API service**.

Historical Enigmas allows users to encrypt messages through a web API, simulating the core principles of the original Enigma machine, using Kotlin and Java EE technologies.
